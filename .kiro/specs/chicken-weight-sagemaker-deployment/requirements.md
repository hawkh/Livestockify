# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves deploying a chicken weight estimation system on AWS SageMaker that can detect chickens in poultry farm images/videos and provide approximate weight estimates. The system combines YOLO object detection with advanced weight estimation algorithms using morphological analysis, neural networks, and ensemble methods. The deployment will provide a scalable, production-ready API endpoint for real-time chicken detection and weight estimation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a poultry farm manager, I want to deploy a chicken detection and weight estimation model on SageMaker, so that I can get scalable and reliable weight estimates for my chickens through an API endpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends an image to the SageMaker endpoint THEN the system SHALL detect all chickens in the image with confidence scores above 0.5
2. WHEN chickens are detected THEN the system SHALL estimate the weight of each detected chicken using ensemble methods
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return detection results with bounding boxes, confidence scores, and weight estimates in JSON format
4. WHEN the endpoint receives requests THEN the system SHALL process them within 10 seconds for images up to 5MB
5. IF no chickens are detected THEN the system SHALL return an empty detection array with appropriate status message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SageMaker model to support both single image and batch processing, so that I can efficiently process multiple images from poultry monitoring systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a single image is sent to the endpoint THEN the system SHALL process it and return results for that image
2. WHEN multiple images are sent in a batch THEN the system SHALL process all images and return results for each image with corresponding identifiers
3. WHEN batch processing THEN the system SHALL handle up to 10 images per request
4. WHEN processing fails for any image in a batch THEN the system SHALL return partial results for successful images and error details for failed ones
5. IF batch size exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the SageMaker deployment to include proper model packaging and containerization, so that the deployment is reproducible and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the model THEN the system SHALL use a custom Docker container with all required dependencies
2. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL load the YOLO model weights and weight estimation models successfully
3. WHEN model artifacts are packaged THEN the system SHALL include all necessary model files, preprocessing scripts, and configuration files
4. WHEN the endpoint is created THEN the system SHALL use appropriate instance types for inference workloads
5. IF model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a poultry farm operator, I want the weight estimation to be accurate and include confidence metrics, so that I can trust the results for farm management decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weight is estimated THEN the system SHALL use ensemble methods combining morphological, neural network, and statistical approaches
2. WHEN providing weight estimates THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores and estimation method details
3. WHEN chickens are detected at different distances THEN the system SHALL compensate for perspective distortion in weight calculations
4. WHEN age classification is possible THEN the system SHALL provide age category estimates to improve weight accuracy
5. IF weight estimation confidence is below threshold THEN the system SHALL flag the result as low confidence

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the SageMaker deployment to include monitoring and logging capabilities, so that I can track model performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the endpoint processes requests THEN the system SHALL log request details, processing time, and results to CloudWatch
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces and input data characteristics
3. WHEN model performance metrics are available THEN the system SHALL expose them through CloudWatch custom metrics
4. WHEN endpoint health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate health status
5. IF resource utilization exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger CloudWatch alarms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious farm owner, I want the SageMaker deployment to support auto-scaling and cost optimization, so that I only pay for the compute resources I actually use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN request volume is low THEN the system SHALL scale down to minimum instance count to reduce costs
2. WHEN request volume increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale up to handle the load
3. WHEN no requests are received for extended periods THEN the system SHALL support endpoint auto-scaling to zero instances
4. WHEN scaling decisions are made THEN the system SHALL consider both latency requirements and cost optimization
5. IF scaling limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle overflow requests gracefully with appropriate error messages
